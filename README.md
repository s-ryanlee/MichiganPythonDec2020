# MAIN TOPIC BRIEF:
Is there a significant relationship between US Covid-19 mortality, age, race, and primary spoken language? What is the impact of 2020’s pandemic on healthcare accessibility? These questions can be answered using Python to extract, visualize and analyze data. This talk features a team of students’ journey in data analysis using Python and R to determine predictors of Covid-19 mortality and the pandemic’s effect on accessibility to healthcare across a variety of demographics.

# Regression Analysis
"The fundamental premise of data modeling is to make explicit the relationship between: 
an outcome variable y, also called a dependent variable or response variable,
and
an explanatory/predictor variable x, also called an independent variable or covariate"

Two variables can be said to have a linear relationship if, when plotted, these points appear to move in a straight line.

Correlation coefficients calculate a numerical value to describe the strength of the relationship between variables

By modeling this relationship, one can make predictions based on the trends existing in the variables.

It is important to analyze the strength of the model created, to ensure this model 'best fits' the original data.
